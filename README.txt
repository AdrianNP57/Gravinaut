Hello, visitor! 

My name is Adrián Navarro Pérez and this is one of my games.

Gravinaut is a side-scroller iOS mobile game featuring 2D retro style graphics where the player controls an astronaut, attempting to avoid a sort of obstacles, mainly meteorites.

You can find more information about me and this project on my webpage:
